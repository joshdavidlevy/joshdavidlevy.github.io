description: When Isaiah encountered our most holy God, he became terrified and cried out, "Woe is me!" Isaiah's experience of the holiness of God is not unlike our own. God's holiness both fascinates and terrifies us. It reveals to us who we are, and that can either drive us away in fear or cause us to cry out for mercy. In The Holiness of God, Dr. R.C. Sproul illustrates the majesty of God's holiness through a biblical and historical study of what people experience when they encounter the Holy One and find ultimate refuge in the righteousness of Christ. <br><br><small>Ligonier Ministries is an approved provider of Continuing Education Units through the Association of Christian Schools International (ACSI).
