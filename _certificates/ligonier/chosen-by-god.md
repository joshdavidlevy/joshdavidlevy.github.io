description: Throughout the history of the Christian church, there has been no shortage of debate over the doctrine of election. This is because predestination appears throughout the Bible and therefore cannot be avoided. But in order to study this doctrine carefully, we must also take a close look at other subjects, such as God’s sovereignty, man’s will, human depravity, and more. In this course, Dr. R.C. Sproul guides you through these important theological topics in order to show ultimately that God’s initiative in salvation drives us to worship.<br><br><small>Ligonier Ministries is an approved provider of Continuing Education Units through the Association of Christian Schools International (ACSI). This course is approved for 0.50 CEU credit.</small>
