description: The kinds of love embraced by our fallen world are at best shadows and at worst deliberate perversions of true love as defined by God, who is Himself love. What is the love of God and what does it mean to be loved by Him? In this course, Dr. R.C. Sproul explores the Bible’s teaching on divine love and its implications for how we ought to love God and one another. This course is designed to deepen your knowledge of God’s love for Himself, His creation, and His children as well as equip you to more deeply love God and your neighbor.<br><br><small>Ligonier Ministries is an approved provider of Continuing Education Units through the Association of Christian Schools International (ACSI). This course is approved for 0.75 CEU credit.</small>
