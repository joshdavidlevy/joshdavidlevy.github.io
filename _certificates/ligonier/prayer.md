description: Christians are given the privilege and responsibility of communicating with the Creator and Sustainer of the universe. Yet many neglect prayer, in part because they do not know how to pray. In this course, Dr. R.C. Sproul teaches some basic steps in developing a faithful prayer life and demonstrates that intimate communication with God is at the heart of our relationship with Him. This course is designed to help you understand that, through Christ, we are accepted by God and enabled to call upon Him as our Lord and Father in prayer. <br><br><small>Ligonier Ministries is an approved provider of Continuing Education Units through the Association of Christian Schools International (ACSI). This course is approved for 0.40 CEU credit.</small>
