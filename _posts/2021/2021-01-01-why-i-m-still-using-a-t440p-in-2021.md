My laptop of choice, the Lenovo ThinkPad T440p was released in November of 2013. For a laptop as old as Pok√©mon X/Y, my daily driver is showing no signs of its considerable age, and I can reasonably hope for many more productive years together.

Although perhaps not widely known among the general public, the T440p is a fan favourite among the /r/thinkpad community. I believe this is due to this particular model hitting several sweet spots between upgradability, performance and price.

```
CPU: Intel Core i7-4700MQ @ 2.40 GHz
GPU: Intel HD Graphics 4600 + NVIDIA GeForce GT 730M
HDD: 256 GB SSD + 2TB HDD
Screen: 14 Inch FHD IPS
Memory: 8GB
```

My first laptop wasn't a ThinkPad (it was a Dell XPi CD), but I do have more than a little nostalgia for the ThinkPad brand. My old IBM carried me through my first two years of college, before being (foolishly) replaced with a Tapwave Zodiac.

## Upgradability

The back panel has only two screws to remove before lifting off, revealing the most upgradable laptop I've ever encountered. All the components you would expect (and some you wouldn't -- like the CPU!) are easily accessed and replaced.

I also [upgraded the stock screen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JwriL1aH-6Q) to an FHD IPS and <u>modded the BIOS</u>.

## Performance

For a laptop this old, I find performance to be pretty astounding. I've had no issues natively editing videos with DaVinci Resolve or trudging through the streets of Revachol in *Disco Elysium*. I beat *Celeste* for the first time on this machine, and occasionally spin up *The Sims 4*. Performance is good, within reasonable limits, though the laptop does get quite hot -- especially in the office. There, I use the Ultra Dock, which has the unfortunate side effect of blocking 75% of the exhaust fan.

It's decidedly not going to run more demanding games like *Cyberpunk 2077* or *No Man's Sky*. When I want to play one of those, I'll cheat a little and use GeForce Now or in-home streaming.

## Price

A used T440p can be found pretty easily for a few hundred dollars, and is, in my humble opinion, completely worth using, even in 2021.
